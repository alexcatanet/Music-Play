# Music Play
This project was developed within the scholarship program (Android Basics By Google).
The goal was to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. For this project, the app does not play music. 
Some elements in this project were inspired by the **Spotify - Streaming Audio Service.**

## What I've learned:
This project is about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include features like:

- Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal

- Creating new activities

- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app

- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.

- Creating your own Custom Class

- Looping through an ArrayList

- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter

##  Project Specification
### App Design

- The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.

- The app contains more than 20 activities.

- The purpose of each activity is easy for a user to understand through the UI design and feature labeling.

### Layout

- The app contains multiple activities, each labeled, which together make a cohesive music app.

- The App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class

- Features in the app are clearly defined either by labeling or images.

- Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity.

- All drawables are stored at multiple densities and all images are stores as drawables

### Functionality

- Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.

- App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.

- Data about each song it is stored in a custom class that contains at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name).
